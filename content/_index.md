Hi, I'm Mano. Interested in compilers/transpilers. Also worked on backend servers, dev-ops. I do have a homelab setup with a Raspberry-PI4, mainly for hosting hobby projects.

Currently working at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/in-en) as Software Engineer on Watson Code Assistant for Z (WCA4Z Transpiler for PL/I)
