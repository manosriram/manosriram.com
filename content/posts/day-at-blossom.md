Today, I visited [Blossom Book House](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blossom+Book+House/@12.9742878,77.6043515,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bae167def9aaaab:0x8c3e58344d3b98b9!8m2!3d12.9742878!4d77.6069264!16s%2Fg%2F11fy4mq_7s?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) for the first time. I have never visited a book store this big, so naturally i felt overwhelmed when I entered the building. It was a dark cloudy afternoon with little drizzles of rain drops. I entered the bookshop and went straight to the first row.

The entire floor was filled with books in all directions, it had some stationary items too. I started looking at shelves one by one and found many old/used books which looked antique. I love non-fiction/biography, so I started to look at that section of books.

I always wanted to read the book [Surrender: By Bono](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61065813-surrender) which Bill Gates suggested in one of his recommendations. It was quite pricey though: Rs 1699 or 19.70$. I found the same used book here for Rs 950 and took it without thinking.

Then, I started walking and had a look with some of my favorite sections: Science, Science Fiction, History. I found many used books here as well. They were quite old and I started picking few of them just to have a look. Some of the book's return date even went back around 1974 as attached in the picture below (They were part of some library before and now ended up here).

It feels fascinating that a book used by people around 1970s, 80s and thinking of the people who might be very old or not even with us right now. I even found a book which was from University of Pennsylvania, it was from '74 as well. As i opened the index page, it was written

`
If this book is found during the term '74, please return it to:
[some address of a person in Pennsylvania]
`

Again, a book used by students in 1974. Right now in my hands after 51 years, is something which I found really interesting today. I started finding few other books as well around that time, but I had to pick some for myself so I started looking for a couple more books.

After a hour of searching, I found a very interesting book [How things work Vol.2 - The Universal Encyclopedia of Machines](https://bestofusedbooks.com/products/how-things-work-vol-2-by-harper-colins). It was vol.2 but it can be read as a first book. The book had details of working of things (with beautiful diagrams) like:

1. Nuclear reactors
2. Metal casting
3. Ship stabilizing
4. Submarines
5. Mines
6. Color televisions

and more (attaching the pics below for the exhaustive list)

This is priced around Rs 700 or 8.12$ but since this is a used one (but felt more antique), I was able to get it for just Rs 250 or 2.9$.

Finally, I found one of best read's author [Mitch Albom "the little liar"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112975105-the-little-liar) (I read [Tuesdays with Morrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesdays_with_Morrie)). I look forward to reading holocaust stories as I get to know the pain people went through during that time that one should't forget.

I got a good collection of books to read for the next few days. Will definitely return back here since one day isn't enough to explore the entire floor.
